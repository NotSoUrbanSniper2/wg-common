Hardware Diversity


Question: What hardware are people using to develop with.


Description:
Determine what affect hardware has on development.  


Objectives:
Determine what effects hardware has on development.  Determine if hardware has an effect on frequency of development.  Determine if hardware has an effect on ease of development.


Implementation:
Filters
Hardware:  hardware specifications and computer models should be analyzed in terms of speed and ergonomics.  Determine if people feel their hardware has an affect on ease of development.


Data collection strategies:
1. Collect hardware data from push requests if possible.
2. Survey devs to get their hardware information.
   1. Question: what is your computer's RAM capacity?
   2. Question: what is your computer’s RAM speed?
   3. Question: what is your computer's storage capacity?
   4. Question: what is your processor model?
   5. Question: what is your GPU model?
   6. Question: what keyboard do you use?
   7. Question: what mouse do you use?
   8. Question: what OS does your computer use?


3. Survey devs to get their opinion on the impact of their hardware.
   1. Question: is your hardware portable?
   2. Question: is your hardware fast?
   3. Question: does it matter if your hardware is relatively fast or slow?
   4. Question: could you make it easier to develop with a change of hardware?
